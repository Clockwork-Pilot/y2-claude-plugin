# Claude Code Plugin

A minimal Claude plugin written in Python that implements hook handlers and logs all hook invocations.

## Features

- Logs all hook events to `hooks.log`
- Returns exit code 0 to allow Claude Code to proceed
- Separate handler configuration for each hook type
- Uses absolute paths for both interpreter and handlers

## Multiple Handlers

The plugin uses a modular handler structure with separate handler files in the `hooks/` directory:
- Each hook type has its own dedicated handler module
- Handlers are dynamically loaded and executed based on configuration
- New handlers can be added without modifying the core plugin logic
